## Explanation of the Asset Configuration Parameters

The asset configuration parameters affect 'test connectivity' and some other actions of the
application. The parameters related to test connectivity action are metioned below.

- **Vectra Base URL:** Base URL of Vectra instance.
- **Client ID:** Client ID.
- **Client Secret:** Client Secret.

## Explanation of the Actions' Parameters

- ### Test Connectivity

  This action will check the status of the Vectra API endpoint and test connectivity of Splunk SOAR
  to the Vectra instance. It can be used to generate new tokens.  
  The action validates the provided asset configuration parameters. Based on the response from the
  API call, the appropriate success and failure message will be displayed when the action gets
  executed.

- ### On Poll

  Polling is to ingest the entity and it's detections and assignments. The user can provide various
  filters for entities and detections.

  ### Prerequisite for On Poll

  - This app should have permission to delete artifact(s)
  - By default, the automation user is selected to run the Vectra XDR for Splunk SOAR ingestion
    action. (See **Asset Configuration** \> **Asset Settings** \> **Advanced** ) The automation user
    does **NOT** have permission to delete the artifacts. This can cause duplication of detection
    artifacts.
  - In order to solve this problem, you must create a user of type **Automation** with
    **Administrator** role. Then, choose this user in your Vectra XDR for Splunk SOAR **Asset
    Settings** under **Advanced** .  
      
    **Administration** \> **User Management** \> **Users** **\> + User**  
      
    [![](img/create_role.png)](img/create_role.png)  
      
      
    **Asset Settings** \> **Advanced**  
      
    [![](img/asset_settings.png)](img/asset_settings.png)  
      
      
  - Make sure severity low, medium, and high is present in soar instance, which comes by default.  
    **NOTE:** To check severity refer this path: **Administration** \> **Event Settings** \>
    **Severity**

  

- Manual Polling (POLL NOW)

    

  - It will fetch the data when initiated, as per the corresponding asset configuration parameters.
    It does not store the last run context of the fetched data.

- **Schedule/Interval Polling**

    

  - **Schedule Polling:** The ingestion action can be triggered at every specified time interval.
  - **Interval Polling:** The ingestion action can be triggered at every time range interval.
  - It will fetch the data every time, based on the stored context from the previous ingestion run.
    It stores the last run context of the fetched data. It starts fetching data based on the
    combination of the values of stored context for the previous ingestion run.
  - **NOTE:** If the user changes the filter related parameter or stored context while the
    schedule/interval polling is running, then the next polling cycle will start fetching the latest
    data according to the updated configured parameters.

<!-- -->

- **Action Parameter: Poll only prioritized entities**

    

  - This parameter has three options - True, False and All.
  - If value is set to True then it will fetch those entities which are prioritized.
  - If value is set to False then it will fetch those entities which are not prioritized.
  - If value is set to All then it will fetch all the entities.
  - These parameters are mainly used for additional filtering of entities. If no entity will be
    found with this filter, there would be no detection or assignments ingested.

- **Action Parameter: Entity type (On Poll)**

    

  - This parameter has three options - Account, Host and All.
  - These parameters are mainly used for additional filtering of entities. If no entity will be
    found with given entity type, there would be no detection or assignments ingested.

- **Action Parameter: Filter entities with given tags (comma-separated) (On Poll)**

    

  - This parameter accepts comma-separated names of the entity tags.
  - This will filter entities which have any of the given tags.
  - **NOTE:** This asset parameter is case-sensitive and the user must provide the exact case match.

<!-- -->

- **Action Parameter: Filter detection type (On Poll)**

<!-- -->

- This will filter detections with given type.
- These parameters are mainly used for additional filtering of detections. If no detections will be
  found with given filter there would be no detections ingested.
- **NOTE:** This asset parameter is case-sensitive and the user must provide the exact case match.

<!-- -->

- **Action Parameter: Filter detection category (On Poll)**

<!-- -->

- This parameter has these options
  - Command and Control
  - Botnet
  - Reconnaissance
  - Lateral Movement
  - Exfiltration
  - Info
  - All
- These parameters are mainly used for additional filtering of detections. If no detections will be
  found with given filter there would be no detections ingested.

<!-- -->

- **Action Parameter: Set container severity 'low' if entity has equal or less urgency score**

<!-- -->

- If value of entity's urgency score is less or equal to this parameter the container's severity
  will be set to 'low'.
- The default value is 30.

<!-- -->

- **Action Parameter: Set container severity 'medium' if entity has equal or less urgency score**

<!-- -->

- If value of entity's urgency score is less or equal to this parameter the container's severity
  will be set to 'medium'.
- The default value is 50.

<!-- -->

- **Action Parameter: Start time for manual polling and first run of schedule polling(Any valid ISO
  date and time format string)**

<!-- -->

- Schedule polling will start from given date and time. In case of schedule poll, this time will be
  considered for the very first polling cycle only. If the user changes this value after the first
  polling cycle, there won't be any effect as the time stored in state file will be prioritised
  after first polling cycle.
- All entities would be fetched which have 'last_modified_timestamp' greater or equal to given data
  and time.
- Only valid ISO format date and time is allowed. Few examples are 2023-02-02, 2023-07-24T14:13:34Z.
- If value is not given it will fetch past 3 days data from the current time.

<!-- -->

- **Action Parameter: Max entities to ingest for manual polling**

<!-- -->

- Restrict number of container(s) to get ingested for manual poll.

<!-- -->

- **Action Parameter: Max entities to ingest for schedule polling**

<!-- -->

- Restrict number of container(s) to get ingested for schedule poll.
